The in-lab section is to be completed during your assigned lab section.
It is to be completed and submitted by the end of the workshop period.
If you attend the lab period and cannot complete the in-lab portion of 
the workshop during that period, ask your instructor for permission to 
complete the in-lab portion after the period.  
If you do not attend the workshop, you can submit the in-lab section 
along with your at-home section (see penalties below).  The at-home 
portion of the lab is due on the day that is four days after your 
scheduled in-lab workshop (23:59:59) (even if that day is a holiday).
All your work (all the files you create or modify) must contain your 
name, Seneca email and student number.

You are responsible to back up your work regularly.

Add your names on top of all assignments.
